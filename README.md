## Overview
---

Yelpcamp is a Yelp-like web application for campgrounds. It was created along with the [Web Developer Boot Camp 2023 course by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy. This course is an up-to-date Full-stack web developer course which covers a wide range of technologies used in modern-day web applications. Along with the technologies learned in this course, I added many of my own features to this site which display my knowledge and ability to learn web-development concepts and best practices independently.

This site contains only fictional campgrounds, but it should give the feel of a real campground review platform. Feel free to explore the site by searching for campgrounds, registering for an account, logging in, and even creating or reviewing campgrounds of your own! I would only ask that you please keep any additions you make kind and professional as this site is meant for educational and professional purposes, and I will receive an email after any change is made to the site.

### You may perform any of the following activities on the site:
- View campgrounds
- Search for campgrounds by name, location, or both
- Register for an account. (Although this site uses secure and encrypted passwords, it is recommended that you do not use any usernames or passwords that you use for anything else, as the site is meant for display and not production.)
- Log In / Log out

### If you register, you may also:
- Create campgrounds
- Review campgrounds
- Edit or delete any campgrounds or reviews you create
